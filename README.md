Importing bikesharing trip data .csv file, creating dataframe in Pandas, visualizations in Tableau

------------------------------
# Overview of Project
Utilizing Tableau and Pandas to visualize bikesharing data in NYC from August 2019. 

## Project Tasks
The analysis will:

1. Import .csv file from NYC Citibike bikesharing website [link]
2. Load into Pandas dataframe to transform datetime column + export updated .csv file
3. Visualize data in Tableau 


## Resources
-- Data Source: 201908-citibike-tripdata.csv, 201908-citibike-tripdata-new.csv

-- Software: Jupyter Notebook, Pandas, Tableau

# Project Summary
Observations from NYC_CitiBike_Challenge work:

-- Typical commute / rush hour timeframes are generally reflected in the overall trips per weekday per hour data. 

-- Weekdays (Mon-Fri) between 7am-9am and 5pm-7pm show the highest number of trips per hour, with Thursday being the highest volume day during the week. 

-- Weekend days (Sat-Sun) see relatively consistent levels of utilization throughout the day between 9am-7pm. 

-- Very similar patterns are reflected across each gender category. The Male category shows the most distinct data, but all three reflect typical rush hour commute timeframes during the week and utilization throughout the day on the weekends. 


From earlier NYC_CitiBike_Module work: 

-- Top starting and ending locations are primarily centralized in midtown/downtown Manhattan. 

-- Trip duration generally trended to be slightly longer for younger riders and shorter for older riders, although there are some outliers to this trend as well.
