# Project Summary

This analysis script can be easily utilized for future election audits. As written, the code has been designed to accomodate any number of candidates or counties, and could be used in a local or statewide capacity. 

This script could also easily be modified to include any number of parameters, such as total votes and/or vote percentages by district or zip code, assuming these data points are included in the original dataset.
